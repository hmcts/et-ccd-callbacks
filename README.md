# Employment Tribunals CCD Callbacks Service

This application is responsible for handling all CCD callback requests for employment tribunal cases that have a case type of either ET_EnglandWales or ET_Scotland.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java)

### Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool but you don't have to install it locally since there is a
`./gradlew` wrapper script.

To build the project please execute the following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew build
```

To get the project to build in IntelliJ IDEA, you have to:

 - Install the Lombok plugin: Preferences -> Plugins
 - Enable Annotation Processing: Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors

### Running

Running the application is best achieved by setting up an environment containing all dependencies. A local development
environment can be created using the ecm-ccd-docker project.
See [here](https://github.com/hmcts/ecm-ccd-docker)

#### Environment Variables
Required:
- ET_COS_DB_PASSWORD
- CREATE_UPDATES_QUEUE_SEND_CONNECTION_STRING
- DB_URL

Optional:
